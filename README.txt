About
This program is a replication of the MVP (Minimum Viable Product), which includes a start screen and an end screen with a small image that is maneuverable using arrow keys to hit a randomized target zone with a score counter for every move made.

States
START - Press ENTER | START on a GBA to start the game
PLAY - Press UP | DOWN | LEFT | RIGHT keys to navigate the image on the screen to direct it to the target zone. Continuous clicking is not allowed to prevent tearing. Press BACK | SELECT to exit and return to the START screen.
WIN - You win if you direct the image to the target zone within 50 maneuvers (aka. score: 250). You can press ENTER | SELECT to return to the START screen.
LOSE - You lose if you fail to direct the image to the target zone within 50 maneuvers (aka. score: 250). You can press ENTER | SELECT to return to the START screen.
